### 3. Key Observations

1. **Participant Discrepancy**
   - Event plans for 500 participants, but budget calculations are based on 100 people
   - This could lead to significant underbudgeting for participant-dependent items

2. **Fixed vs. Variable Costs**
   - Fixed Costs (flat rates): ₹82,990 (12% of budget)
   - Variable Costs (quantity-dependent): ₹573,510 (83% of budget)
   - Contingency: ₹32,825 (5% of budget)

3. **Cost per Participant** (based on 100 people)
   - Direct per-person costs: ₹331 (materials only)
   - Total per-person cost: ₹6,893.25 (including all expenses)

### 4. Potential Concerns and Recommendations

1. **Participant Number Adjustment**
   - If 500 participants are expected, participant-dependent costs need to be recalculated
   - Potential additional cost: ₹132,000 for materials and badges alone

2. **Technical Support**
   - 24-hour technical assistance is a significant cost
   - Consider if full 24-hour coverage is necessary

3. **Venue Capacity**
   - Ensure the venue can accommodate 500 participants
   - Current furniture rental (50 tables) may not be sufficient

4. **Contingency Planning**
   - 5% contingency may be low for an event of this scale
   - Consider increasing to 10% given the potential for participant number fluctuation

### 5. Budget Efficiency Metrics

1. **Cost per Participant Hour**
   - Event duration: 24 hours
   - Cost per participant per hour: ₹287.22

2. **Category Efficiency**
   - Highest ROI: Workshop materials (direct participant benefit)
   - Potential for optimization: Technical assistance timing
